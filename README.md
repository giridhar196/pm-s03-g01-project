### Our Project
   <strong>Project Title:</strong> Ecommerece Website<br>
   <strong>Project Tagline: </strong>Buy from me any where<br>
   <strong>Team Name: </strong>Easy and Effortable<br>
   
**Summary:**<br>
* We are online portals that facilitate online transactions of goods and services through means of the transfer of information and funds over the Internet. 
* The order manager queries your database to find out if the sweater of that exact color and size is actually in stock.
* Nobody likes waiting, not so many people can actually wait. So show your customers that you appreciate their time and donâ€™t make them suffer.
